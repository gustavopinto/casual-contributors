# SANER 2016

This document presents the steps needed in order to reproduce the data used in our SANER'16 study. Read on for the guidelines.

## Github Data

Here we describe how we downloaded and analyzed Github data.

### Finding the projecs

Using [GithubArchive](http://githubarchive.org/), we used the following query in order to select our initial set of projects:

```
SELECT
  a.repository_name as name,
  a.repository_owner as owner,
  a.repository_organization as organization,
  a.repository_watchers AS stars,
  a.repository_forks AS forks,
  a.repository_language as language
FROM (
select *
from [githubarchive:github.timeline] a
where a.repository_language = "Haskell"
) as a
JOIN EACH
  (
     SELECT MAX(created_at) as max_created, repository_name
     FROM [githubarchive:github.timeline]
     GROUP EACH BY repository_name
  ) as b
  ON
  b.max_created = a.created_at and
  b.repository_name = a.repository_name
ORDER BY stars desc
LIMIT 20
```

For each programming language analyzed, we changed the ```where``` clause, where it appears ```Haskell```, for the programming language we intent to analyze. We ran the query and the result we stored in a CSV file. Create a single CSV for each programming language. Here is the full list of projects downloaded. 


### Downloading the projecs

After saving all required CSVs, run the program [cloner.py](https://github.com/gustavopinto/casual-contributors/blob/gh-pages/cloner.py) in the same directory that you saved the CSV files.

```
python cloner.py
```

This script will try to clone each project in the current directory.

### Analysis

After downloading all required projects, it is time to analyze them. Use script [contributions.sh](https://github.com/gustavopinto/casual-contributors/blob/gh-pages/contributions.sh) to generate inidividual casual contributions.

```
./contributions.sh
```

Use script [casual_contributors.py](https://github.com/gustavopinto/casual-contributors/blob/gh-pages/casual_contributors.py) to parse this data in a CSV fashion.

```
python casual_contributors.py
```

Use script [loc.sh](https://github.com/gustavopinto/casual-contributors/blob/gh-pages/loc.sh) to generate lines of code data for each project. This script requires that the program ```cloc``` is installed.

```
./loc.sh
```

Use script [difference_contributors.py](https://github.com/gustavopinto/casual-contributors/blob/gh-pages/difference_contributors.py) to generate data regarding the number of projects and their number of contributors.

```
python difference_contributors.py
```

## Surveys

We conducted two surveys: one with the casual contributors, and the other one with the project maintainers.

### Casual contributors questionnaire
