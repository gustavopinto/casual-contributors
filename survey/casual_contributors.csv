2015/11/03 11:59:27 AM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;;;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;;
2015/11/03 12:00:08 PM GMT-3;Daily;No;Missing Features;Can commit that much time to those projects.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;Personal need.;Move project forward in the single thing that is very annoying for me/my main project. Unfortunately contributions can hang for a long time in the review pipeline.
2015/11/03 12:07:25 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;Fix issues that I am experiencing. Fix bugs that are reported to me as a Debian package maintainer.;Because I'm not interested in becoming a long term contributor. For those projects I'm an advanced user with development skills...;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I'm chosing what I use, and I make casual contributions to projects that I use where I have a need.;The problems is that such contributors are not always aware of all the rules and infrastructure around the project. The benefit is that the more casual contributions you get, the more long term contributors you might get... and the experience as a casual contributor makes a great impact on my willingness to continue to use the given software.
2015/11/03 12:08:53 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;Finding bugs at work, or projects that I find that are interesting.;I typically just need to fix a bug in something.;Once every 6 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Neccessity;
2015/11/03 12:12:53 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;The change is needed for something I am working on for my employer.;Generally busy with other work related projects.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;;

2015/11/03 12:18:07 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;Needed latest version to fix a blocking bug.;Generally the project is good enough on its own for my needs, except for issues I jump in to help that impact me.;Once every 6 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;If there is a bug that impacts me. Solve my own problems.;Helps move project forward, but also may add to technical debt of project. Commits may be of lower quality for the codebase than core contributors who understand the context.
2015/11/03 12:18:15 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;Missing feature / bug in something I use;I'm active in enough projects already;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;See answer #3;It adds a new feature or fixes a bug in something I use
2015/11/03 12:18:19 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;Fix a bug that I really want to be fixed;I do have long-term open source projects, cannot contribute a lot everywhere. ;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;It has to be something I use;Fresh look on the project is good, but works only for easy projects
2015/11/03 12:20:18 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;In the specific case of the linux kernel I was motivated by http://eudyptula-challenge.org/;Often I just need some bug to be fixed because I'm stumbling over it;Monthly;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;If I see a bug, I fix it;One problem is certainly that I'm not that deeply involved in some of the projects I'm contributing to. That means I'm not as aware of the history of a project as some long term contributor.
2015/11/03 12:23:56 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;when its necessary;because I am busy;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;projects I use;I ran into a problem w/ project and then I solved it for myself and contributed back to community 
2015/11/03 12:24:53 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;I needed features not yet provided by the projects.;Mostly lack of time and interest.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Only if I need it for my work or hobby projects.;More commitment would be better, I guess? On the other hand, every contribution is a contribution and brings the project forward.
2015/11/03 12:25:30 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;By contributing, I solve my own (and potentially others') issues with the software I use.;"It's difficult to commit to owning a project that you didn't originally create - it would be difficult to completely ""own"" the project without being a major part of its development.";Weekly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;If I see a potential improvement that is fairly easy, I'll take the opportunity. The art of communal software development is to make the path toward contribution easy.;The benefit is that many people can improve the project, but only as much as the original software developer intended - nobody could re-engineer firefox's engine easily, for instance.
2015/11/03 12:30:28 PM GMT-3;Daily;No;I used the software and wanted a very specific feature.;After some time, I noticed that this specific project is not really suitable for my use case, so I abandoned it and with it also the contributions.;Once every 6 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I do not choose a project to contribute to, I just modify projects I use and then share these modifications with the public.;
2015/11/03 12:30:36 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;I want to fix bugs in software I use.;I often don't have a sufficiently full grasp of the whole project to be a useful long-term contributor nor enough time.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Whatever I'm using that needs fixing.;Reducing bugs.
2015/11/03 12:33:29 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;You find a bug that needs to be fixed and you'd like to have it done upstream so you'd don't have to keep patching it.;Usually it's something that's tangental to my main work. Just a small wrong/broken thing I notice and would like to fix, but I'm not really invested in the project. If they accept the change great, if not I don't really care.;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Again it's usually just problems I notice when using something: a broken link in a read me, out dated instructions, etc;You save someone else the trouble of running into the same issue you did.
2015/11/03 12:34:51 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;when the problem affects me personally, and I can solve it quickly;I don't like programming for long;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;software I use personally;benefits: the same problem would likely recur for other users, and now it's solved.  they might not solve it if it could only be done through a lengthy commitment.  drawbacks: can't think of any.
2015/11/03 12:35:45 PM GMT-3;Once every 6 months;Yes;Some bug I hit or see and I can fix and have the time for it;Lack of time, some times. Some others, the project it's not technically interesting;Once every 6 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Hit a bug or see a Debian RC bug blocking a release most of the times;No problem, just the benefit of having a patch fixing a bug :)
2015/11/03 12:36:49 PM GMT-3;Once every 6 months;Yes;The most common reason is that I am using the library and it's functionality I need myself, so I usually inquire whether the project owner is interested in the functionality instead of forking;I do not have much time or energy after work to contribute to other projects for long periods of time;Once every 6 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I almost definitely have used the project either at work or in a side project. I will typically contribute if I find a bug that I can fix or if there is functionality that I would like that complements the project;Often responses to pull requests are slow because you are not well known. Slow or unhelpful responses from project owners often lead me to abandon my contribution
2015/11/03 12:38:29 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;It's a bug that annoyes me which i can resolve myself;Too busy with own projects;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It's a program I use myself and contains a bug or can be improved in my favour;
2015/11/03 12:38:47 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;No;Fixed a bug, contributing changes back is the right thing to do.;Not interested, don't have resources/time/energy to contribute more.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;"The programs I use or need. If I can fix a problem and easily send back my changes; I will.";"PRO: Fixes for often undiscovered problems; often small/less hard problems can get fixed. 
CON: missing trust;"
2015/11/03 12:41:14 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;Bugs in private projects that use open source code;I work full time in private projects. I contribute when I need to fix a bug or improve something in an opensource project I've been using on these private projects.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Most of them are just ruby gems that I included on some private projects;The good thing about opensource is that anybody can contribute. No matter what are the reasons, any contribution is welcome. I don't actually see any problems in casual contributions.
2015/11/03 12:41:56 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Fixing a bug that affected me;I'm a user of the project but have no interest/time in ongoing development.;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Fixing a bug, or occasionally adding a small new feature;A bug fix is much more useful than a bug report, provided the fix is correct and fits in with the architecture and conventions of the project.
2015/11/03 12:43:36 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;Found a bug, and rather than waiting for someone else to fix it I can do it myself.;Usually I work on multiple projects and sometimes I find a bug which stops me from proceeding my work. Its a matter of fixing it or waiting for someone else to do it.;Yearly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;When doing my regular work I encounter a bug that needs fixing or a feature that is lacking.;The biggest problem is usually to understand the code base in order to fixing issue at hand. At the same time that is a benefit for me, learning how to quickly understand code I haven't written myself.
2015/11/03 12:44:02 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;No;My friends ;While developing if i get error or found something wrong i correct it and send pull request. ;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I am using that project in my work;Accoding to me it has benefits like you have good felling after contributing. 
2015/11/03 12:45:24 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Something to be fixed;I do multiple contributions when other things need to be fixed;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;The projects I use and I would like to see evolving;It takes time to learn contribution rules of the project and to see how the code works only for one contribution, this is not very effective
2015/11/03 12:45:37 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;No;If I have my personal issue with some open source project I fix it myself.;I have no time to be active contributor. I make contribution just as a part of my daily work.;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It is always a project I use in my daily work.;Many casual contributors can successfully help to fix project issues. But casual contributors will never make architectural improvements to any project.
2015/11/03 12:46:51 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;most of the time it's 'scratching my own itch': I find an issue within an application / library, that I need enough so I dig deeper into the source of the problem - if I find the reason and it's easy enough to fix, I do so, and of course send the patch upstream;most of my 'casual contributions' need only a short time (typically less than an evening, at most a weekend), while I don't have enough time for being a regular contributor to that many projects. also, most these contributions may fix something I need within a larger context of the whole project, where I don't necessarily have continuous interest in.;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;spot something (supposedly) easily fixable or I need the fix myself relatively urgently;"major benefits: fixing issues that the (typically few) main contributors do not feel that important, but could be still important/useful for the 'long tail' users.
problems: may not be aligned to the major contributors' plans; with the coding (or ortherwise) conventions of the projects; uneven contribution quality; checking license terms; relative high effort of small fixes (as need to learn into individual projects)"
2015/11/03 12:47:33 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;Fixing an easy issue of a project I'm currently using. Finding bugs to help make the project more stable. Helping with documentation which generally is left behind. Motivate developers of the project to continue with their efforts, knowing there is an interested community. ;Generally, it's because the lack of quality time to fully engage on a project that probably won't produce any income. There is always interest in helping project to stabilize/be better, and if there's a chance to give a little help that doesn't compromise the current duties, it's always welcome for the project owners.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;If I'm really interested in the success of the project because I think the idea is great and may use the project in the future for myself.;Benefits: it helps stabilize a project as the main devs tend to focus on the big issues and leave a lot of small issues which are important with low priority. I haven't had any problems contributing ocassionally to projects. 
2015/11/03 12:47:39 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;It depends on the software I'm using at that point in time, but if I'm using it often and I find a flaw, I'll correct it.;Aversion to long-term responsibility for a project in addition to my full-time job.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Based on OSS I'm using at that point in time.;OSS recognition, dialogue about said software.
2015/11/03 12:48:41 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;I usually will find small errors or omissions in documentation or examples for projects I'm using, and that makes me want to fix them. Fortunately, it's so easy it usually only takes a few minutes for me to make the change.;Because I don't have time to contribute to all the projects I use, but I still want to help out where I can.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Usually it's software I use in my work or for personal projects. ;The biggest benefit is when casual contributors help with docs or examples, since core developers don't use the introductory docs often so errors can persist for a long time.
2015/11/03 12:49:29 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;In this case, the documentation was incorrect, which caused a great deal of frustration. ;These projects are often used as part of my work and my contribution is necessary or helpful for my work's use case.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;When documentation is incorrect, or desired behavior is missing but relatively simple to add.;The benefit is improved functionality/documentation for the project. A few problems are a lack of developers familiar with large portions of the code base (I know nothing about Elasticsearch's code base in this case), and the contributions tend to be much smaller than what a habitual contributor might do (drive-by commits rarely rearchitect an application).
2015/11/03 12:51:00 PM GMT-3;Once every 6 months;Yes;Usually fixing an individual problem in something I am using or trying out.;I have enough time commitment in my private life already.;Once every 6 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I use it, find something that I need changed/added, then send back upstream.;"Outside eyes can be helpful in spotting things that people closer to the project have overlooked; however, lack of familiarity with a project in the whole can make it difficult to know where to look to solve a more complex problem."
2015/11/03 12:53:03 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;When I need a feature that the code does not have;Because I have better things to do;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;If it doesn't have the required feature;I get the feature I need
2015/11/03 12:54:45 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;Finding a specific bug relating to a piece of software, and finding a solution;Many projects are peripheral to my focus. Active contribution requires strong management and vision that aligns itself with individual expectations, which is rare.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;I don't look for the opportunity to make casual contributions, the opportunities present themselves as necessities when I find solutions to problems that affect me.;Being able to accept casual contributions in a standardised way has a lot of potential for a range of insights but as a directive it can lead to a fragmentation of authority and direction that leads to bloated and imprecise software.
2015/11/03 12:55:28 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;particular bug;watned to fix a particular bug;Once every 6 months;;wanted to fix a particular bug;
2015/11/03 12:56:40 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;It is a project or dependency I am trying to use and notice an issue.;Lack of time.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;Usually the project I use for something else or is a dependency of a project I use.;Well the benefits are: projects get help, it helps the community, it helps the contributor (as it solve a problem they possibly have).
2015/11/03 12:57:01 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;I use a lot of open source software and I often read through some of the code before I do. If I see something that is wrong or needs improving and its within my skills and I have the time then I'll attempt to fix it and submit a pull request.;Usually because I have projects of my own that I am working on and I can't spare the time. Also many projects need specialist knowledge or skills that I don't have so my contributions are usually small easy fixes. ;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Usually it's a project I am thinking of using myself.;"One benefit is that I can free up time for the core contributors to focus on the more specialist areas. It would be even better if they were able to label issues that don't need a lot of special knowledge to fix. Some repositories on github add an ""easyfix"" label to help people find them."
2015/11/03 12:57:32 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;Often something that bugs me. Or fixing a common use case I find myself in.;No commitment/no expectations;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;Something I use myself;May bring expertise in a certain area/situation. May lack vision, style guide and long term effects. 
2015/11/03 12:58:17 PM GMT-3;Monthly;No;Lack of a feature;No bandwidth;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;Complexity of a project , lack of documentation and no feedback;Project may become stale.
2015/11/03 12:59:32 PM GMT-3;Monthly;No;That was a task I got from a challenge, see http://eudyptula-challenge.org/;That was the intent to be a long-term contributor, but my  http://eudyptula-challenge.org/ challenge not complete yet.;Yearly;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;That was a task I got from a challenge, see http://eudyptula-challenge.org/;That was a task I got from a challenge, see http://eudyptula-challenge.org/. I never thought about this, actually. And it's not easy to get a commit in in linux kernel tree, even it's a casual one. It takes a lot of effort to make it work. It's a first step to get a feeling of how this thing should work. It's not like you make a commit in your work. People who review your commit has even more strict criteria to accept your commit. So, to answer this question directly, the change I made pass the inspection from the reviewer. The benefit is that it's just a  commit to address a single problem. I don't see there is any problem. What if there is not name in the commit, can you tell a casual commit is a casual commit. All commits are just trying to fix an issue or develop a feature, right? 
2015/11/03 1:00:07 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;When I find bugs or need a new feature;I'm using their library/module/etc. to build something else, for myself or a client. So I want to focus on my pet or client project, but I'm happy to help nudge their project forward with small contributions. (If it would be a large effort I would write my own FLOSS module instead of investing a large amount of time in someone else's project.);Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;If I'm using it already and it has a big or I can add a new feature I need. ;I look at it as a way to give back and a way to shorten the bug fix lifecycle for the other project. If you have a fix ready for them, it may get pushed to master and published the same day even. 
2015/11/03 1:02:25 PM GMT-3;Monthly;No;I want to improve the quality of the project and that is good for my reputation.;I do not have enough time to invest deeply in a big open source project. I do not have a test case not covered by the project that could allow me add a big functionality to the project. I prefer investing time in a little open source project, maybe initiated by me, in order to get a good return on investment of that time, expertise, reputation, money.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;I have an issue using it, or some functionality is not covered.;The benefit is that it will correct some very special issues that the dedicated committers do not meet, but the real users have. Once they have the issue, it is very easy for those real users to create a test case and correct the issue with it, whereas it would be very expensive/impossible for the usual committers to create all the possible test cases, and check that the application solves them. The problems are that it can inject bugs or useless complexity because the casual developper is not aware of the architecture or the software.
2015/11/03 1:03:06 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;Fixing bugs.;The projects are usually not the goal of our work, but something that we use.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;If we need features or bug fixes to any OSS project that we use.;Mutual benefits. They have the fixes, we unblock ourselves.
2015/11/03 1:03:15 PM GMT-3;Monthly;No;Solve an issue while working on a or with a project.;Push fixes when I encounter issues when using a project and able to solve them.;Once every 6 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Project I use or want to use for home or work projects.;Some projects don't have the organization or the will to manage commits from a lots of different contributors.
2015/11/03 1:03:46 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Small fix on OS projects I'm currently using;Because I'm mostly focused on using existing frameworks/libraries that are stable. That's the reason I'm mainly doing small fixes. ;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Those that I'm using on my current project.;The main problem is that I'm not building a strong relationship among a project members. The benefit is focusing in my personal/client project.
2015/11/03 1:04:34 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;I want to give back something;To make the software better and to give back something to community;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;In most cases this is the product that I use somehow;Problems - author can make pull request and disappear. Benefits - it is always good when someone wants to contribute. This makes the project better.
2015/11/03 1:05:43 PM GMT-3;Weekly;No;"Remove a ""land mine"" where it looks like something should work but it doesn't.";Mostly for fixing ancillary tooling for an organization, so I can continue with my main focus.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;I was using the tool/software, got bit by a misleading situation and wanted to fix it so others don't waste their time.;Benefits are allowing barriers to entry to be low.  Problems are it can lead to a fragmented community.
2015/11/03 1:05:44 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;Bug fixes during early stages of software development whilst number of key contributors is low.;Prior commitments do not allow sufficient time to engage actively.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Based on our needs at the time.;Benefits are that we get quick fixes in without reliance on existing contributors. Drawback is perhaps starvation of input if the proportion of casual contributors is high (I'd guess).
2015/11/03 1:07:36 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;No;happy to help if it is a simple thing;lack of time;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;A project I use;Difficult to contribute without deep understanding of a codebase. A simple fix is easy and hopefully helpful

2015/11/03 1:08:45 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;It doesn't do something I need, or I find a bug I can fix easily;If everything works as I need, there's no need for further changes!;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;If I use it in a project and notice something I can fix / add;Bugs get fixed, features get added (where they align with the main author[s])
2015/11/03 1:11:13 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Getting bug fixes upstream.;Because I can't be an active contributor for every project I use;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I contribute to everything I have contributions for;
2015/11/03 1:13:33 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;When I encounter simple bugs and/or find that certain features are lacking;I have dozens of projects of my own to maintain already, no need to support already active projects;Weekly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I fix bugs/issues that bug me;It fixes my problem immediately
2015/11/03 1:16:06 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;Patching something I use or a bug/typo I see when looking at some code;I may not have time, much interest in the project or be allowed to do so by my employment contract;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Something I use for some private project or that I just read;I don't see any problem here, depending on the patch I may solve problems for other people
2015/11/03 1:16:17 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;;;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;;
2015/11/03 1:16:31 PM GMT-3;I did just few contribution, but it is not common;No;Fixing bugs that may or do hinder with my work. It's best for the bug to be acknowledged and fixed in the main project so that it can be peer reviewed and maintained by others, as opposed to making a branch and having to keep it up to date myself.;No time and lack of interest.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I don't choose or search for a project to contribute, I search for projects that are useful for my work, and if I find a bug on them, I try to submit a fix.;To have many people gather to help solve a problem... How can this not be beneficial? The only problem that I can see is if the contributions are not properly reviewed by the project maintainers, so that it ends up braking some other thing (tests should be enforced for all contributions) or breaks the coding style (I find consistency important).

Also, I've occasionally encountered bugs that I want fixed for my own personal needs.;I've work for contributing companies during my career like ARM and Broadcom.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Work related to support specific Broadcom/ARM hardware. Personally, if it's an area I consider myself competent in and there's a feature or bugfix that I would like too I will attempt to implement it myself if I have the time,;The more contributors there are the faster bugs get fixed and new features get implemented. Casual contributions can be inefficient since you need to spend time becoming familiar with each project before making contribution. If you spent on your time on one project you'd get more done but if that's was the model I wouldn't be a contributor at all  since I would lose my motivation.

However, if for whatever reason I encounter a problem and it costs nothing to me to help to some software I've used accidentally, or daily, I believe a PR is the minimum I can do to help and thank them, instead of just whining around about project's problems.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;if it's on my way, for whatever reason, and I find a problem, I contribute either filing a bug or sending a PR if I know how to solve and it doesn't take too much effort.;"It's complicated. When it comes to file a bug, if you don't read previous possible duplicates, if you don't put down properly the bug, your contribution might result in a huge waste of time for you and for projects maintainers. This happens so often that  usually unknown contributors are rarely welcomed, or their bugs are rarely even read or understood. They closed a PR of mine few days ago because the project maintainer didn't actually even read what was the problem and how my PR was solving it (yes, they had to come back after another person filed the same bug with the same kind of solution  as second PR where I have to write that if it takes 2 PRs to solve a single problem the project might not go that far). Similar things happen all the time even with PRs, developers are always excited about making PRs,  specially to famous projects, but most of the time they do it in a superficial way: no tests, no proper explanation about the why,  the what, and the how, but they feel like their PR should be accepted regardless and most of them get pissed if it doesn't. I am actively maintaining many projects, mine and not mine, and I've seen this kind of situation over and over, even in other repositories I've personally tried to  contribute. TL;DR it benefits everyone when a bug is filed in a proper way, with test cases, expectations, and as many details as possible ( but not too many or nobody will read it ) ... it also benefits everyone when a PR is done properly: tests in place, explanation, details, problems that are actually solved instead of imaginary problems that might be just picky and not actually real-world problems. Specially latter category can generate huge flames which is most of the time a pointless waste of time  for every-bloody-body!"

Also, if there is a contribution made on a higher level of knowledge (or simply bad coding style) it discouraged further (casual) contributions since - in my case - I don't spend a lot of time in them.
Benefits: Contributors have different strengths and some things, that are for some of us ""just casually contributed"" will take a lot of effort for others. So if I can casually distribute a thing (which knowledge may have taken me a lot of time to achieve), I'm more likely to do so."

But I've really only done so one time so I may not be the best one for the survey.;Lack of overall knowledge of the project, lack of historical knowledge are problems.  The benefit is that you bring a fresh perspective on something that others who are closer to the project might not have considered.

The only exception are bug-fixes that affect the projects I am working on.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;Mostly I contribute to tools that I need to use. So when getting a benefit from a free tool I pay with my time and effort to make it better. Thus everybody gets the benefit.;"The benefit is that many of the small issues are resolved; especially problems that are small and you would not usually see or even have time to fix. The problems are minimal, as a project owner you need to have a process in place for accepting contributions. Accepting these pull requests can take time."

I was not planing to enhance them and work as a developer for it as I already spent time on my daily job.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I contrite to projects that I use for my daily job.;Assuming the project has stable, dedicated development team I see no drawbacks with casual contributors. They mostly fix small issues the mainstream was blind to spot.

After some hours of puzzling and fixing the problem I tend to at least try to share it with the world.;Mostly because lack of time / interest. Not all projects need 'my' help, they work quite well. Sometimes a small bug can be fixed easily. For bigger activities that require more time, I usually wait until others fix them due to lack of time.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;The things I need for my work / hobby and don't work out of the box and can be easily fixed.;Others don't have to perform the same puzzle I did, saving them time and frustration.
2015/11/03 8:17:32 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;I like to make contributions to things that other people can use. I don't have time to contribute large or difficult things. But I know from experience that most people aren't going to take the time to suggest fixes for typos or things like that. So, if something trips me up (such as a broken link in documentation), I will often take the time to fix it (if there's a clear method to do so). Another motivating factor is if the software is useful, fun, and / or cool it feels good to make it even a tiny bit better.;Lack of time firstly. Also, in many cases, I probably don't have the knowledge.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It's pretty much always this: I'm using something and encounter a bug or typo. If I can easily determine a way to submit the suggested change and I think it won't take too much time, then I'll submit the suggestion. I don't care at all what the nature of the project is, who the developers are, or even what the licensing is. So, targeting is all based on what I happen to be using.;Benefits: (1) Makes software incrementally better for potentially large number of users, (2) Is fun to help out, even if it's a tiny contribution, (3) potential learning experience. Problems: (1) it takes time to convince myself that my contributions are correct and worthwhile, (2) there's a risk the developers won't care, (3) it takes time away from whatever higher-priority things I have to do.

Not many problems though.
2015/11/03 9:12:40 PM GMT-3;Monthly;No;I care about FLOSS projects, I want to see them improve and prosper.;Usually because I lack the necessary skills for such a commitment.;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;When I notice something missing or buggy in software that I use and when there is a process in place that permits/encourages contributions.;"It could be a lot of work for the projects' principal maintainers dealing with different coding styles, tracing bugs back to snippets of code they did not conceive and putting it all together. Even though these are FLOSS projects and everyone is free to contribute as much or as little as they see fit, casual contributors are not part of the core workforce and they could be (or perceived to be) even less dependable.

On the other hand, someone outside of the box, probably has a thinking to match; a fresh pair of eyes examining a particular problem/task that the main developers are not familiar with, can provide fresh input and quite frequently a solution. In many cases, the core team needs access to equipment they do not have in order to troubleshoot or to add support for a particular scenario/device. The outsider with such access can help in that area. This is just one case when crowd-sourcing is valuable to the project."

There are many other projects that benefit from drive-by contributions.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I'll be using an open source project for professional or personal use, and see an opportunity to fairly quickly fix or improve something in a way that benefits myself and others.;The ideal is a combination of drive-by contributors to fix/improve superficial issues and identify edge cases, combined with a smaller group of active contributors to guide deeper issues and design decisions.
2015/11/03 10:00:11 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;I use the software. Contributing to it helps me avoid relying on forks and contributes to a healthier software community. It also feels good.;Many projects have existing maintainers. For a lot of projects I am simply a user. I am find contributing where I can, however otherwise following the vision the maintainer already has for the project.;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;If I find a bug, I'll often submit a PR to fix it instead of filing an issue. This ensures that it gets fixed faster. As a maintainer of my own projects, I know how much work goes into these projects and how good it feels when someone helps you out.;When the barrier to entry when fixing bugs on a project is low, software flourishes. When there are too many cooks in the kitchen, software dies.

If I found something that was sufficiently interesting, then who knows. But for now I spend enough time dealing with other programmers when I get paid for it. :);Yearly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Only generally when something I've been using has broken, and it seems like less effort to contribute than it does to work around the problem. For the contribution you sent me in your email, I was asked by jeresig to send in a patch after I had mentioned the bug.;Well, I rarely hear people complain that they have too few people contributing to their projects.. So I think it's likely positive overall.. But of course, people who rarely submit patches to a project won't know (or care about) the processes of the project, so the admin time of a person who makes a one-off patch is going to be quite a lot higher than a regular contributor.

After becoming familiar with using a project, it is easy to make small contributions.;The benefits I see are that many of us can think of more than a few of us. The problems I see are when the casual contributions encompass large refactorings, introduce significant changes to APIs, or derail the intention of the project.

I made this contribution simply because I saw how to fix the issue. I believe if you already know how to fix the issue it is better to propose a pull request instead of reporting an issue and waiting for other developers to fix it. That's what open source is about.

2015/11/04 9:58:31 AM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;"Improving software I use.
Finding a bug nobody had found yet and being able to come up with a solution.";"Understanding a software and the way it works (, sometimes also learning a new programming language, tool or framework, ) takes time. I'm already working with code at my job. Sadly, the piece of software I'm working on has very few Free/Open Source Software in it and isn't a free/OS software itself.

I've read some bug trackers in the past to see if I can find simple bugs to begin with but haven't been inspired (yet). Poor or incorrect documentation on how to set up a minimal development environment or simply building the project are  also real obstacles to contribution.";Yearly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I use lots of Free/OS tools and try to open an issue if I find a bug, but it didn't happen much. When finding a problem, I look at the code to see if I understand it. If I can come up with a solution, I submit a pull request, if not I open an issue. Sometimes, bug has already been solved but fix not yet been released.;"Benefits: 
* Bugs solved (or highlighted)
* Show where the project might need documentation
Problems:
* Contributors might not be aware of the implication of their modification on other components of the software."
2015/11/04 11:48:08 AM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;Fixing a bug in software I use;I don't have time to fix everything. I only work on projects that interest me or fix bugs that affect me.;Once every 2 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;If I find a bug in software I use and I have time to fix it, I fix it.;Bugs get fixed in a scalable way without wasting time on trying to reproduce the issue, explaining it and etc. While also freeing the time of the maintainers of the relevant projects to work on more involved changes.
2015/11/04 12:12:32 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;I'm fixing bugs that prevents me from getting my work done;I'm working with many technologies and I do not have time/will to focus on one project.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I'm active user of all projects I contribute to.;It good because it can fix random/unexpected problem in project. It is bad, since contributors often do not want to follow all project procedures (like signing CLA, search for code reviewers, writing tests and etc).
2015/11/04 12:45:50 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;Fixing my own problems, adding features that I need, or fixing typos;I do not have time to contribute long term. I contribute only to solve my own problems.;Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;They are projects that I decided to use for our non-OS software.;I don't have to patch and maintain the software myself. I can fix a bug, or add a feature, and it continues to be maintained by the rest of the community with no additional overhead required by me.
2015/11/04 1:25:15 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contribution, but it is not common;Yes;When usage of the FOSS project reveals a bug, I am motivated to fix it.;Don't have the time to contribute long-term.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I usully make contributions to projects that I depend on in my own projects and at work.;Benefits: bugs are found and fixed. Problems: Can't think of any.
2015/11/04 5:53:56 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;If I encounter an annoying bug that I can fix quickly, I'll do it myself.

Problem: disruption of workflow for projects without maintainers aware of such drive-by fixes. 

The bigger problem for the projects comes when the fix isn't acceptable as proposed. For example, the submission might lack tests or have spelling errors. It might work for 80% use case but not the rest. Or, worst case, it's already been done but the fix wasn't apparent to the user, e.g. it was fixed in another branch. Then that user wasted time. That's happened to me more than once."
2015/11/04 7:15:34 PM GMT-3;Once every 6 months;Yes;Fixing bugs or enhancing in libraries I use.;Because I don't have time to devote to a more active role.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Usually they're projects I use. So I follow the same criteria than for choosing a third party library: active development, active project leader, nice documentation, etc.;I love it when my PRs get merged, it's a nice feeling. The problem is when a project gets abandoned (I know because I have myself abandoned a few) and the owner does not have time to review and merge your contribution.
2015/11/04 8:10:25 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;Yes;I found an error that hadn't yet been fixed.;I don't normally run bleeding edge code and I'm not usually interested in working on new features so I end up mainly working on bugs.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It has to be something I'm using on a frequent basis.;I think it helps with edge cases.  Not everyone runs software or hardware in the same configuration and it's helpful to be able to find rare faults and correct them without having to wait for the normal development team.  I can't think of any downsides off the top of my head... in my case the changes still needed to go though the normal approval process so it would seem to me that the chances of making a problem worse are low.
2015/11/04 8:48:13 PM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;Necessity. Most of my contributions come from issues/missing features I encounter myself in OSS.;Lack of time.;Weekly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Interest and necessity. ;Casual contributions allow me to still help without committing too much.

2015/11/05 6:01:41 AM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;I want to fix some single issue in a project;I fix the things I need to use only, for the parts that I need to use;Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I am using it myself, and it has a bug or a missing feature;Project receives bugfixes instead of bugreports which is a huge time win, but maintaining consistency, code quality, test cases, architecture, etc. becomes harder. Needs active code review policies and good contributor management in general.
2015/11/05 7:04:33 AM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Fixing bugs I've encountered using the software;Usually the software does what I need except for the bugs I've encountered, I don't have enough time to contribute further, or the project is not very welcoming for new contributors;Once every 6 months;I contribute to one project and make FEW casual contributions.;A tool that I'm using which works apart from minor bugs or missing features;The problems are ignored contributions or unwillingness of core contributors to accept that bugs exist or that contributed code is correct. For projects that are more welcoming I often end up making more than one contribution.

2015/11/05 1:15:36 PM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;No;I use a lot of open source/free software in my 9-to-5 job. Many times it's easier and faster (and better for the community) to prepare a patch for a problem in a 3rd party library/framework then it is to log a bug and wait for a resolution from the maintainers.;I mostly do bug fixing in projects I use every day. If I were to contribute to an open source/free project daily, it would most likely be one that I started on my own. Unfortunately I do not have the time for that at the moment.;Once every 6 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I contribute (mostly) bug fixes to projects that I use daily and for issues I am unable to find in their issue tracker.;I would imagine it's harder for new features to land via casual contributions. But when it comes to bug-fixing I can only see benefits.
2015/11/05 1:20:47 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;No;The web site (angularjs) solicited corrections to their documentation. Their linux install instructions were not working. Since I was able to get it working, it seemed like a good idea.  They did not disclose that this would leverage github until after I clicked the button. If they had, I would not have done so.;I have my own projects tht fill my time.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;If I need it for my project, and there is a bug where I think I have a generic solution that others would appreciate.;There are no benefits. In one case (angularjs) I was treated rudely by the project stewards. Mostly, the contribution is ignored. There are a couple exceptions, and I will continue to contribute to those projects. But for the most part, I no longer do this.
2015/11/05 10:43:06 PM GMT-3;Yearly;Yes;Usually it's to solve a problem that I'm having.;I just want to solve my problem. I don't have much spare time to spend on open source.;Yearly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It's something that I'm using and need to modify in some way for my own use.;Main benefit is that the project gets updated in some way. Downside is that casual contributors often don't follow the project conventions of contributing. It takes some work from the maintainers to make sure the contribution is clean enough to meet project standards.
2015/11/06 12:36:54 AM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;If I see a fix I can implement, I will.;Some projects are ones that I'm interested in, or find neat.  They're not necessarily ones that I'm super vested in though.  If I see an error that I know I can fix in a few minutes via the github editor, I will.;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I normally look at software I use or find them via http://reddit.com/r/coolgithubprojects;Patches are always welcome.  Though in turn, casual ones may be rejected more often as they may not be up to the project's standards due to the contributed not being invested to much in it.
2015/11/06 12:45:58 AM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;I learn things and the devs gave me the app for free.;I work and study.

2015/11/06 7:12:27 AM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;Yes;Fixing a bug or adding a simple/small feature, or adding support for special behavior of my systems.;Programming is just a hobby, not my full-time job. I ran or am still running some small open source projects where I am the single contributor. I'm contributing more actively to projects/modules I actually need for my job, giving back small improvements or fixes needed to get it up and running as part of our own projects.;Once every 6 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;It depends on requirements for my own projects. If something needs to be fixed or improved and it is easy to do so, I will give the contribution back to the community, otherwise I may simply choose a different project which fits my needs.;Benefits are sort of crowd-sourced fixes and improvements as long as they are small. Bigger fixes need long-term support and long-term contributors which know the code better, know the progress, and the long-term plan. A project consisting only of short-term contributors implementations is probably not going to work well and may become unmaintainable which would be a problem.
2015/11/06 10:51:08 AM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;Fixing issues or improving libraries I use. Need.;Typically just because my professional job takes that time.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Typically it is a library I use.;Less credibility/responsivity in some projects when coming in as an outsider with a patch
2015/11/06 11:46:42 AM GMT-3;Once every 2 months;Yes;To improve things for others using the skills/knowledge I have. Often making docs easier after I've found them lacking.;Lack of time, motivation for any given project and lack of skills (most of the low hanging fruit is gone);Once every 2 months;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Ones I use and find useful.;Benefits are crowd sourcing i.e. if lots of people casually commited then you'd have a lot of things fixed or implemented. However, it's extra overhead for the project owners/maintainers - especially if the commits are below their normal standard of quality i.e. code style, testing etc.
2015/11/06 12:52:23 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;I use a project, and something is broken.;I'm generally satisfied with the project., but just need my bug fixed.;Once every 2 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;I use the project already.;Trivial bugs find fixes in the community, but trickier bugs require more effort to merge.  Projects can get swamped with low quality fixes.
2015/11/06 5:33:13 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;No;Already solved issue in private work.;Lack of time.

This is driven by found issues.;It is hard to predict pace of contribution.
2015/11/07 1:01:17 AM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;It never hurts to help.;"Scratch my own itch. The benefit of contributions to time spent is non-linear to me and to the projects themselves. Sometimes little improvements make big impacts (on usability, UX, maintainabilty ..etc.).

Eg. take a look at my bugreport about puppet-selinux. It was a really anoying bug.";Monthly;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I get annoyed about something. Like pandoc/gitit being wordclass but having a link broken in the documentation. It bugs me.;Sometimes I jump to conclusions. But because I am lazy no real damage has ever been done.
2015/11/07 4:52:41 AM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;Yes;I came to find a bug.Or there are't a function I need,so I made it myself.;I think I don't have much experience and time,passion.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;I benefit from these projects.And I'm interesting in them.;Just a little fix for some small bugs.
2015/11/07 2:47:31 PM GMT-3;I have made just a few contributions, but it is not common;No;I just like the feeling you have when contributing to a bigger project by adding a small but interesting feature, and then see that that feature is used by many other developers.;The projects I'm contributing to already have a strong core of developers but were missing some features that I needed. That's why I decided to add the features by myself instead of waiting for another user to make it.;I did just few contributions, but it is not common;Most of my contributions are  casual contributions;Simply because the needs of the moment. I'm only contributing to projects I use in everyday-life, at work or as a hobby.;The main benefit is that the project gets new features quicker than it would normally with the core-team developers. The counter-part is that there might be no support. In my case, I've just added features that fit my needs, and that's it, I'm not giving long-term support to it.
2015/11/07 3:20:04 PM GMT-3;Daily;Yes;In that case it was a typo, which is possible to send a pull request for on github.com with only a few clicks. In the case of chaplin, I know the people building it personally. ;I contribute to open source software that I use myself. If I find a problem, I fix it, because I can. ;Weekly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;"Usually on of these reasons
1. I use it myself and found an issue with it
2. I got to the page by chance, and found an issue by just looking at the code (usually typos)
3. Someone asked me for help";"Benefits: everyone can contribute, everyone benefits
Problems: human communication is hard. As a project owner, I can't accept every contribution / suggestion. People at times feel to entitled to time / attention of others. It's not a technical issue, GitHub did a great job to lower tech barriers, it's all about communication"
2015/11/07 4:34:52 PM GMT-3;Monthly;Yes;Give back (in a small way) to software that I benefitted from. It's a community effort.;Ruby on Rails is a big complex project. Becoming a active contributor would require a ton of time and effort.;Once every 6 months;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;It's usually a project I use but is broken in a small way;Benefit is that people who find a problem in a project can fix it for others without the maintainer having to do everything. Problems may be there is a burden on the maintainer to accept a casual contribution that is low quality.
2015/11/08 7:53:35 AM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;"I participated in a workshop at my University that demonstrated how to contribute to the Linux kernel.

2015/11/15 6:50:06 AM GMT-3;Weekly;Yes;I usually contribute to an open source project when I want to solve a specific problem (bug or feature) that I have. In the case of the referenced commit, I just wanted to give something back to the Django community because I use Django almost daily. I made this contribution as part of a Django community hackathon which they call sprints.;I tend to be more focused on the professional or personal projects that I'm currently working on so I don't have extra time or motivation to become a full contributor. That said, I have become a maintainer of a couple of projects (including a Django side-project: django/django-localflavor).;Monthly;I mainly contribute to one (or few) project(s) and make casual contributions to MANY projects;Generally based on trying to solve a specific issue or problem that I have.;The core developers can focus on the big architecture problems and features, while the casual contributors can polish the rough edges to make the software work well for the various edge cases.
